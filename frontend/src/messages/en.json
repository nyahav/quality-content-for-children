  "section-2-body": "The 'Science in a Click' website provides answers to curious children, who cannot join frontal classes during the difficult days of the war, via engaging and educational science videos that are both enjoyable and enriching. The project was founded by a group of Ascola Alumni Network members aged 20-30, who as children enjoyed watching science videos and they joined forces in this project to collect and review recommended videos for the next generation of scientists. These videos are not a substitute for the official school curriculum; rather, they offer an engaging and supplementary educational experience.",
